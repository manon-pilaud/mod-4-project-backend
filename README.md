This personal organization web application is inspired by the popular bullet journal method. This method gained popularity due to the simplicity and effectiveness of keeping everything in one place. Therefore, this application has tried to replicate this by keeping a simple, decluttered layout, with a diverse set of input fields for the user to keep track of anything they need to maintain an organized life. It has a calendar page that contains all user events. Upon clicking on a day on the calendar the user is taken to that days show page. From this page, the user can add, edit and delete notes, track their mood and water intake for the day, add and complete tasks and create, edit and delete events. These events are reflected on the monthly calendar page. Days are created in the database when the user navigates to its show page to avoid unnecessary use of memory.
